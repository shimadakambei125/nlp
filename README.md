Title: NLP for Hyperion project

This application shows what I've learned by applying the spacy module to
tokenize sentences as well as applying the entity method to help understand
how this module helps with natural language processing.

How to run/install

The python code can be ran on any python IDE.  It has a dockerfile with it that allows you
to build an image and run that image on a docker desktop.

This project is mainly to show our understanding and simple application of the spacy module
and a scaratch to the surface of NLP.
